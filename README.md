# GroundwaterModelingProject1
This is the first project from CE4352: Groundwater Modeling taken at the University of Minnesota in the spring of 2012. The project description as well as the write-up of the problem solution can be found in the PDF document titled "Thurmes Groundwater Modeling Project 1.pdf".

The project was to model a well field near a river. The task was to estimate the total discharge of a well field such that no river water is captured by the wells. Models included scenarios where there was only one well and scenarios where there were three wells. This was done using the Analytic Element Method, a numeric method for solving partial differential equations; coordinate transformations; and complex equations to describe the discharge potential and streamlines in the area of interest.
